# Annotated Target

A static analysis tool for PHP 8 to gather all the places an Attribute is used in a given codebase. In short, give this tool a set of directories, and we'll provide a Generator that yields information wherever an Attribute is found. You can filter by Attribute types to get info for just the things you need.
